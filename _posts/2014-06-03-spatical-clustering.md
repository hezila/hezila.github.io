Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (NBSCAN)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The basic idea for DBSCAN is that for each point of  a cluster the neighborhood of a given radius ($$$\varepsilon$$$) has to contain at least a minimum number of points ($$$MinPts$$$) where $$$\varepsilon$$$ and $$$MinPts$$$ are input parameters.
