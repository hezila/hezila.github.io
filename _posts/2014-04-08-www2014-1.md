The WWW2014 Conference Notes
============================

08th April, 2014
----------------

### Mining User Trails in Critiquing Based Recommenders

*** Dataset (restaurant critiquing history) ***

#### Towards a scalable Social REcommender Engine for Online Marketplaces

* real-time

* scalability

* social-network

### Dating matching

* reciprotocal revealed preference

  use LDA to infer the revealed preference emerged in the users' behaviors

09th April, 2014
----------------

### Personalized Collaborative Clustering

* Richer Interacitons

* Tensor y(u, i, j) = 1 if i and j are grouped into same cluster by u

* semisupervised clustering (labeled by crowdsourcing)

* conduct a user study

* [Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization for Personalized Tag Recommendation](http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2010/proceedings/docs/p81.pdf)

* applications

    * group recommendation
    * tag recommendation
    * list recommendation



### LCR: Local Collaborative Ranking

* Ordering Problem

* the rating matrix is low-rank only locally

* PREA toolkit is opensource.

### COBAFI: Collabarative Bayesian Filtering

* Limitation: Gaussian assumption

* Goals
    
    * Fit the recommender distribution

    * cold-start/cool-start/few ratings

    * spam and fraud

* model

    * co-cluster users and items (extend probabilistic matrix factorization)

    * [great!]the recommender distribution [Tan et al, 2013] 

### Yandex 

* Switching detection Challenge 2012

* 


### Repeat consumtption

* BrightKite: location checkins
* G+: ppublic location checkins

* MapClicks: clicks on Google maps business

* Youtube: last 10K video waches

* Shakespeare

* popularity
more frequently consumed items are morel likely to be reconsumed

* recency
How does the recency of consumptions affect thlieklihood of reconsumption?
to answer this question, we usa cacehe-based analysis technique

the hit ratio is an indication of the degress to which recency is displayed in a consumption history

Real consumption sequences display a significant amount of recency

user-leel item popularity generally postive xxx

* model *

1. quality model: item quality dictates consumption behavior
  simply th eemprical fraction of occurences

2. recency model: we formulate a copying model based on recency
    additive in weights
    item was consumed i steps ago and j steps ago
    maximize likelihood with SGD

3. hybrid model

log-likelihood per item of models, normlizec by log-likelihood of hrybird model

we learn a wieght for each possible previous position
weights follow power law with exponential cutoff




### Demograhics, Weather and Online Reviews: A study of restaurant recommendations

Endogenous: restauants can control
Exogenous: restauant cannot control

Weather & offline bahavior
 Weather & season


840K restaurant
1.1M reviews (text, time, locaiton)
demographics and weather condition (using weather station)


* Modeling reviews: Negative binomial regression
  count variable

* Modeling rating: cumulative linke model (orderred logistic regression)


Monetary effects:

* Low-priced restaurants:
	   fewer reviews
	   lower ratings

* Online promotions:
       more reviews
       not necessarily higher ratings

Higher population, higher education and higher racial -> higher likelihood reviewed

Dataset is available

### Twitter timeline generation
