<p>What is sigmoid? what is sigmoid CPD? why can it reduce parameters? and what can it capture?</p>

<h2>What is Sigmoid</h2>

<p>Actually, <em>Sigmoid</em> is a function with name <em>sigmoid function</em>. It's a mathematical function having an <strong>S</strong> shape (sigmoid curve). Often, sigmoid function refers to the special case of <em>logistic function</em> shown below and defined by the formula</p>

<p>$$ S(x) = \frac{e^x}{1+e^x} $$</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>$$ S(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$</p>

<h2>What is Sigmoid CPD</h2>

<p>Sigmoid CPD(<em>Conditional Probability Distribution</em>) is an variant of linear CPD, it just applies a sigmoid function on the linear result. And the parameters in Sigmoid CPD are just the weights in the linear relationship. For distribution $$$P(y_1 \mid X_1, X_2,…, X_n)$$$ , the linear CPD is</p>
<p>$$ P_L(y_1 \mid X_1, X_2, …, X_n) = w_0 + \sum_i^n w_i X_i $$ where $$$w_i$$$ is the weight of each variable, and $$$w_0$$$ is the bias.</p>

<p>so the sigmoid CPD is $$ P_S(y_1 \mid X_1, X_2, … X_n) = \frac {1}{1+e^{-P_L(X_1, X_2, …, X_n)}}$$</p>

<p>Compared with traditional CPD, whose number of parameters is proportional to $$$ \prod_i^n d_i $$$ ($$$n$$$ is the number of variables and $$$d_i$$$ is the cardinality of the i-th variable), the number of parameters in Sigmoid CPD is reduced to $$$n$$$.</p>



<h2>What can Sigmoid CPD capture</h2>
<p>Sigmoid CPD can only capture the effect of each variable for the <em>weight</em> is applied to each variable independently. But it can not capture relations between variables because there are no interaction terms between variables(unless one of the variables is a function of some set of other variables, but this is a special case).</p>

<p>For example, Consider genes A and B that might be involved in spinal muscular atrophy. Assume that A has 2 alleles A1 and A2, and B has 2 alleles, B1 and B2. Which of the following relationships between A and B can a sigmoid CPD capture? (From <a href="https://class.coursera.org/pgm-003/class/index">Coursera PGM class PA2 quiz</a>)</p>

<p>1. Alleles A1 and B1 each independently make a person likely to have SMA.</p>
<p>2. When the alleles are A1 and B2 or A2 and B1 the person has SMA; otherwise the person does not have SMA.</p>
<p>3. Neither gene A nor gene B contribute to SMA.</p>
<p>4. Allele A1 and allele B1 make a person more likely to be have SMA when both of these alleles are present, but neither affect SMA otherwise.</p>
<p>5. Allele A1 and allele B1 make a person equally more likely to have SMA, but when both are present the effect on SMA is the same as when only one is present.</p>
<p>6. Allele A1 makes a person more likely to have SMA, while allele B1 independently makes a person less likely to have SMA.</p>
<p>7. Gene A contributes to SMA, but gene B does not contribute to SMA and thus does not affect the effects of gene A on SMA.</p>

<p>The answer is <strong>1, 3, 6, 7</strong>.</p>

<p>For each choice, reasons are:</p>

<p>1. Since their contributions are independent, a sigmoid CPD that weights the alleles for each gene based on the extent of their contribution would capture this perfectly.</p>
<p>2. This XOR relationship means that the effect of the allele for gene A depends on which allele for gene B is present; since the sigmoid CPD does not have interactive terms, it will not be able to capture this.</p>
<p>3. A sigmoid CPD can capture this by giving alleles for copies of gene A as well as alleles for copies of gene B weights with value zero.</p>
<p>4. This AND relationship cannot be captured by a sigmoid CPD because interaction terms between the alleles are not present.</p>
<p>5. This AND relationship cannot be captured by a sigmoid CPD because interaction terms between the alleles are not present.</p>
<p>6. A sigmoid CPD can capture this by making the weights for the indicators for allele A1 positive while making the weights for the indicators for allele B1 negative.</p>
<p>7. A sigmoid CPD can capture this by giving the alleles for copies of gene A positive weights and the alleles for copies of gene B zero weights.</p>
